Virus Validate Update

A web based database application that focuses on managing business appointments are verifying vaccine/wellness information. The idea is to have a streamlined way to set up requirements for symptoms or illnesses that would be checked before being given entry to an event or meeting. Everything is built to be modular enough that simple code changes can be made to work with an existing database enviroment, just point VV's frontend to the correct API, or if you want everything to be self contained use the included backend that works with MongoDB.

This was initial a group project but has been given extended functionality and features to focus on making the API meet restful standards.

-backend is a nodeJS server that runs a restful API and stores data into a mongoDB

-frontend is a vite (nodeJS + React) server that runs the frontend to interface easily with the API
